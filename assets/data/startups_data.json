ATLAS was founded on the ideal of providing affordable access to space for all. We believe that providing an exceptional level of service shouldn't be cost prohibitive. Stemming from the innovation in the satellite and launch sectors, there became a data bottleneck on the ground - with no solution in sight. Enter ATLAS. Unlike legacy ground solutions, ATLAS utilizes a software-centric, cloud-based approach - the Freedomâ¢ Software Platform. This proprietary software allows us to cut costly overhead, streamline operations and allow customers to gather more data, faster from space for use in the real world.",
